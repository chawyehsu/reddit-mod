  - Boxed: content is centered and has a maximum width (of 1024px)

## Installation

1. Install [Stylus] extension for your browser.
2. [Install the css style with Stylus][1].
3. Go to [Reddit], navigate to `preferences`:
    - Uncheck `allow subreddits to show me custom themes` under the `display options` section
    - Turn off `Use new Reddit as my default experience` under the `beta options` section
4. Choose your preferred options in the settings page of the style.
5. Refresh the page and enjoy!

**Note**: There might be some corner cases that the style doesn't work well.
If you find any, please open an issue and I'll try to fix it.
